/*! \mainpage Overview

QPIXL++ is a C++ package for compiling and compressing quantum circuits for quantum
pixel (QPIXL) representations.QPIXL++ is build on top of QCLAB++. It can simulate the QPIXL circuit to verify the image representations and provides I/O through openQASM making it compatible with quantum hardware. 


## How to run?

The QPIXL++ package uses the CMake build system (CMake version â‰¥ 3.16).
The recommended way of building the QPIXL++ library is as follows:

1.      Install
        \code {.bash}
        git clone https://github.com/QuantumComputingLab/qpixlpp.git
        \endcode

2.      CMake
        \code {.bash}
        cd qpixlpp
        mkdir release
        cd release
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
        make -j8
        \endcode

3.      Run tests
        \code {.bash}
        ./test/qpixl_tests
        \endcode

4.      Examples
        \code {.bash}
        ./examples/compressedFRQI ../examples/Example0.pgm ../examples/output 0 0
        \endcode
        
5.      Generate documentation
        \code {.bash}
        doxygen doxygen.dox
        \endcode

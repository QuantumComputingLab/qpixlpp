# QPIXL++ - Quantum Image Pixel Library [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5557893.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5557893)

The QPIXL library currently supports the compilation of compressed quantum circuits for Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) that contain quadratically fewer gates than previous implementations of FRQI and are NISQ-friendly as the circuits only contain CNOTs and single qubit rotation gates. 


## How to run?

The QPIXL++ package uses the CMake build system (CMake version â‰¥ 3.16).
The recommended way of building QPIXL++ is as follows:

1. Install

        git clone https://github.com/QuantumComputingLab/qpixlpp.git

2. CMake

        cd qpixlpp
        mkdir release
        cd release
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
        make -j8

3. Run tests

        ./test/qpixl_tests

4. Examples

        ./examples/compressedFRQI ../examples/Example0.pgm ../examples/output 0 0

   For help

        ./examples/compressedFRQI --help

5. Generate documentation

        doxygen doxygen.dox
